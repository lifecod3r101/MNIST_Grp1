We were able to train a sequential neural network model composed of three layers. The first layer was the input layer that had a flattening function, the second layer was a keras dense layer composed of 
128 neurons and Relu as an activation. Finally an output layer of 10 neaurons. The model was trained to recognise handwritten digits 0-9 based on MNIST dataset. The dataset was composed of 70000 images of 28px by 28px
and labels which was split into 10,000 for testing, 48000 for training and 12000 for validation. In the the notebook you will be able to find graphs of accuracy and loss graphs for training and validation.
Confusion Matrix was also generated to show number of correct predictions on each class (0 - 9).
